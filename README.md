# Transfer Entropy

Implementation in python3 of transfer entropy statistic between two time series.  

Transfer entropy from X to Y, where X,Y are two random processes, is an asymmetric statistic measuring the reduction in uncertainty for a future value of X given the history of X and Y. Or the amount of information from Y to X. Calculated through the Kullback-Leibler divergence with conditional probabilities
